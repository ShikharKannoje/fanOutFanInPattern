# fanOutFanInPattern
Sample fan out fan in pattern in Go

In this example, the fanOut function distributes the work to multiple worker goroutines.

Each worker processes items from the input channel concurrently.

The fanIn function then collects the results from all these workers and multiplexes them into a single channel.

This pattern shines in scenarios like parallel data processing or distributed computing tasks.

For instance, you could use it to process large datasets by splitting them into chunks, processing each chunk concurrently, and then aggregating the results.

It’s also useful in scenarios where you need to make multiple API calls in parallel and combine their responses.

The Fan-Out, Fan-In pattern allows you to leverage parallelism effectively, potentially leading to significant performance improvements in your Go applications.

However, it’s important to consider the overhead of creating and managing multiple goroutines and channels.

In some cases, if the processing of each item is very quick, the overhead might outweigh the benefits of parallelism.
